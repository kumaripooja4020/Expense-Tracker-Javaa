Subject: Assignment Submission â€“ Expense Tracker

Hello,

Please find my submission for the Expense Tracker assignment.
Iâ€™ve implemented the project using Java, as I am more comfortable with it.

I am genuinely interested in learning and improving my skills â€” if you give me the opportunity, I will definitely put in the effort to learn and complete this in Python as well.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Pooja Kumari
